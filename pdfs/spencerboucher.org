* Summary

  I am a data scientist interested in full stack machine learning. I believe
  that the most effective data scientiests are the ones that firmly grasp
  statistics and machine learning theory, but also have enough engineering
  know-how to actually implement solutions. I aspire to mastery over both these
  domains.
