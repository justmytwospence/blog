I enjoy learning new things just as much as I love teaching and communicating
ideas to others. My goal is to always be working on hard, interesting problems
that require creativity.

* Experience
** [[https://www.uber.com/][Uber]] \descript{Data Scientist} \location{January 2014 -- Present}

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :environment tightemize
   - Developed and implemented an algorithm for ranking restaurants in the Uber
     Eats mobile app, personalized for each individual user to make sure they
     can find their perfect meal.
   - Optimized the dispatch radii of restaurants on the Uber Eats platform to
     minimize delivery time and maximize value.
   - Served as machine learning liaison to multiple teams, onboarding diverse
     machine learning use-cases onto a new centralized machine learning
     platform, including churn models, supply prediction, and rating systems.
   - Implemented crucial back end features of Uber's internal machine learning
     platform, including performance reports and diagnostic dashboards for
     trained machine learning models.
   - Performed analysis and modeling that powered data driven decision making and
     strategic expansion of operations in the United States and abroad.
   - Developed Bayesian models to infer ride sharing market conditions in cities
     around the world.
   - Authored numerous ETL pipelines in Python and Hive to craft high velocity,
     high volume raw data into useful features for statistical modeling.
